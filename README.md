# PlutoApp
hacked together electron pluto.jl app that runs in the system tray.  
not finished, only tested on macos, doesn't work when built  
  
Compared to JuliaPluto/PlutoDesktop, it is much simpler and uses existing julia/juliaup.
  
Requires juliaup install with working environment path.  
Defaults to beta release.
