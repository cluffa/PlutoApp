# PlutoApp
Hacked together electron pluto.jl app that runs in the system tray.  
Does not exit julia processes very well.
Not finished, only tested on macOS and windows.  
  
Compared to JuliaPluto/PlutoDesktop, it is much simpler and uses existing julia/juliaup.  
  
Requires juliaup install and uses default channel.
